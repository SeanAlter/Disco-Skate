Discord Bot Repo
This is the repo for Alter's Python Bot, it started by using <Insert name's> basic bot and then modifying it to my amusement.

Features:
-roles adduser <role> <user> //Add a user to a role, only works for roles the bot has permission to add people to
-roles removeuser <role> <user> //Reverse of above
-registertwitch <twitch name> //Register a twitch as yours, the bot will announce when that twitch channel is live in all servers the user is in (that the bot is in too) P.S. does no authentication, because it doesn't really care if its yours or not.              
-rolldice <# of dice> <dice side amount> <# of dice> <dice side amount>     //Roll the dice! Cause its fun
-report <What ever line you want to drop me>  //This sends me a report letting me know if something is wrong or if you want me to change something

Planned updates/features:
Signal Catching //Allows a soft kill of the bot allowing it to save off information
Levels //Track the amount of chats and gives player levels
Modular updating //I will split up the code into multiple python files that allow me to update the code and then have it reload without restarting the bot
Youtube playing //some sort of audio playing, haven't really fleshed out what I want out of this yet
